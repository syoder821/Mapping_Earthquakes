# Earthquake Mapping Challenge

# Basic Project Plan
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.  

## Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.  Add addtional map layers to select major earthquakes and tectonic plate layers.  

## Approach
JavaScript and the D3.js library is used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.  Layer controls are used to add interactive controls for 3 basemap layers and 3 earthquake data layers.
